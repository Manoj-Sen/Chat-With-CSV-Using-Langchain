# Chat with your CSV: Visualize Your Data with Langchain and Streamlit

Langchain is a Python module that makes it easier to use LLMs. Langchain provides a standard interface for accessing LLMs, and it supports a variety of LLMs, including GPT-3, LLama, and GPT4All.
In this project we will show how to use Langchain to analyze CSV files. We will use the OpenAI API to access GPT-3, and Streamlit to create a user interface. The user will be able to upload a CSV file and ask questions about the data. The system will then generate answers, and it can also draw tables and graphs.
